      Employee’s employment under this Agreement is referred to as the “Part-Time Employment Term”.</p>

    <h6>III. DUTIES</h6>

    <p>A.	During the Part-Time Employment Term, the Employee, as a Sales Representative for the Employer, shall devote substantial business efforts and time (on a part-time basis) to the effort to expand Employer's business by informing and educating members of the medical community, and other

    <h6>VI. TERMINATION</h6>
    <p>A. This Agreement may be terminated by the Employee at any time.  When the Employer receives notice of Employee’s voluntary termination, the
      Employer may, at its sole discretion, immediately effect the voluntary termination of the Employee’s employment. Any voluntary termination of this Agreement by the Employee as described in this provision shall terminate the rights and obligations of each of the parties except as to those which

    </p>

    <h6>VII. CONFIDENTIALITY, NONSOLICITATION, NONCOMPETITION, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h6>
    <p>
      A.  Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. During Employee's Part-Time Employment Term, and continuing thereafter following any
      termination of such part-time employment, without the prior written consent of the Employer, except to the extent required by an order of a court having jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency (in which event, the Employee shall use his reasonable efforts to consult with the Employer prior to responding to any such order or subpoena), and except as required in the performance of his duties hereunder, the Employee shall not disclose or use for his benefit or gain any confidential or proprietary trade secrets, customer lists, information regarding business
      development, marketing plans, sales plans, management organization information, operating policies or manuals, business plans, financial records, or other financial, commercial, business or technical information (a) relating to the Employer or any of its Affiliates or (b) that the Employer or any of its Affiliates may receive belonging to suppliers, customers or others who do business with the Employer or any of its Affiliates (collectively, “Confidential Information”) to any third person unless such Confidential Information has been previously disclosed to the public or is in the public domain (other than by reason of the Employee’s breach of this Section VII).
      <br/><br/>
      B.  Non-Competition. During the period of the Employee's part-time employment with the Employer, and for three (3) years following termination thereof, irrespective of the reason for such termination, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, become employed in any capacity by, engage in business with, serve as an agent or consultant or a director, or become a partner, member, principal or stockholder of, any Person or entity (or help any third party commence, support or expand a commercial operation) that engages in, competes with, or has a reasonable potential for competing, with any part of the current or prospective business of the Employer or any of its Affiliates (the “Business”), nor shall Employee, directly or indirectly, provide, accept or offer to sell any clinical laboratory services, or any other services provided by the Employer, to any customer of Employer (or accept said
      services) which was Employer’s customer during the period of Employee’s employment with Employer, or during the period two (2) years before Employee’s employment with Employer, or upon whom Employee called as a prospective customer during Employee’s employment with Employer.
      <br/><br/>
      C.  Non-Solicitation of Employees and/or Employer’s Vendors. During Employee’s employment and for three (3) years following termination thereof,
      irrespective of the reason for such termination, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, for his own account or for the account of any other Person or entity, (i) solicit for employment, employ or otherwise interfere with the relationship of the Employer or any of its Affiliates with any individual who is or was employed by, or with any vendor who provided services to, or was otherwise engaged to perform services for the Employer or any of its
      Affiliates in connection with the Business at any time during which the Employee was employed by the Employer, or (ii) induce any employee of the Employer or any of its Affiliates, or any vendor to Employee, to terminate his or her employment with, or terminate the services provided to, the
      Employer.
      <br/><br/>
      D.  Return of Documents. Upon termination of the Employee’s Employment for any reason, the Employee shall deliver to the Employer all of (i) the
      property of the Employer and (ii) the documents and data of any nature and in

      whatever medium of the Employer, and he shall not take with him any such property, documents or data or any reproduction thereof, or any documents containing or pertaining to any Confidential Information.
      <br/><br/>
      E.  Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Employee contained in Section VII relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants, obligations or agreements will cause the Employer
      irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, the Employee agrees that the Employer shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem
      necessary or appropriate to restrain the Employee from committing any violation of such covenants, obligations or agreements. These injunctive
      remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have and the provisions of this Section VII shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

    </ul>
      <br/>
    <p>Employee shall have full access at all times to any and all billing and receivable data pertaining to clientele procured by Employee. If this agreement is terminated by either the Employee for voluntary purposes or by Employer for cause as described in Section VI (A) and (B), Employee shall continue to receive compensation according to the per sample arrangement for a period of no less than two years from the date of the termination.
      <br/><br/>

      <br/><br/>
      If Employee elects to introduce other employees to Employer, and cooperatively operate as sales manager of said employees, Employee may receive “overrides” for consideration of his or her management of such other employees, and their compensation may be shared as overrides to the Employee provided, however, that the Employee effectively manages such sales teams that shall be actively and diligently working to further the business of
      Employer pursuant to a written employment agreement.  Therefore, the Employee shall manage employees in a sales capacity; thereby enabling the
      Employee an override percentage (that is to be determined on a case by case basis) in earned commissions from said other employees that may be
      introduced in the future.
